# Sales & Profitability Analysis Case Study (Excel Data Cleaning + Pivot Insights)

## Overview
This project is a simulated/class case study analyzing a company’s sales and operations data. The original Excel datasets contained issues (missing values, duplicates, inconsistent geographic fields, unclear identifiers), so the first step was data cleaning and validation. After preparation, I summarized profitability trends across products, regions, and customers and provided business recommendations to improve profit.

## Tools / Methods
- Microsoft Excel (data cleaning, validation, formulas)
- Pivot tables & summary calculations
- Visual analysis (charts for product, region, and customer profitability)

## Process
1. **Data quality assessment:** identified duplicate records, missing identifiers, inconsistent location fields, and unclear definitions.
2. **Cleaning & standardization:** removed duplicates using unique order IDs; standardized city/state/ZIP; corrected mislabeled/inaccurate entries; assigned unique IDs where duplicates existed.
3. **Analysis:** built pivot tables to evaluate profitability by product, region/state, and customer.
4. **Insights & recommendations:** translated results into actionable business decisions.

## Key Findings (from the analysis)
- **Profit is concentrated in a small number of products.** A few high-margin products (e.g., Dynamo System, Optimum Super System) drive a disproportionate share of total profit.
- **Geographic profitability is uneven.** A small set of states generate most profit (Texas strongest, followed by Florida and California).
- **Customer concentration risk exists.** A small group of customers drives outsized profit; the top customer contributes nearly double the next highest.

## Recommendations
- Prioritize inventory, marketing, and incentives around **high-margin products**; evaluate low performers for repositioning or discontinuation.
- Align sales targets and compensation with **profit**, not just volume or revenue.
- Invest in **high-performing regions** and diagnose underperforming markets for pricing/fit issues.
- Implement **strategic account management** for top customers while diversifying to reduce concentration risk.
